# Aegis TODO

## High Priority
- [x] Initialize and populate submodules for core components (`termpair`, `authx`, `llama.cpp`, `n8n-mcp`).
- [x] Implement the `improve.py` self-improvement script.
- [x] Set up the `legos-dev/` directory with initial logging and performance tracking modules.
- [ ] Fix integration gaps between `llama.cpp` and `n8n-mcp`.

## Integration Tasks
- [ ] Tighten `authx` integration with the terminal sharing system.
- [ ] Ensure `Jwt-Spring-Security-JPA` covers all API endpoints.
- [ ] Create visual performance dashboard or logging system.

## Research
- [ ] Find more repositories with similar setups to identify best practices for integrations.
- [ ] Document "extreme cases" for testing the holistic setup.

## Completed
- [x] Initialize `framework.md`.
- [x] Initialize `todo.md`.
